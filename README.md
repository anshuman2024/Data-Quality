Data Quality: Assessing Outlier detection is a crucial problem with many applications. Outlier detection issue statements seek data points that reveal aberrant system behavior. Identifying and comprehending such data points, which are a small percentage of the population, is crucial to system health. A common outlier detection problem is credit-card fraud detection. The most common sort of fraud in e-commerce marketplaces is credit-card fraud, hence effective procedures are needed to detect it. Changing fraudulent activity patterns complicate credit card fraud detection. Because fraudsters continuously coming up with new ways to avoid government checks and balances online and swindle people. Changing patterns and fewer identified data pieces make marketplace security difficult.

While working at eBay, the writers wrote the research report quickly.

Our Part We used a unique unsupervised clustering-based technique on ann-thyroid & credit-card fraud detection dataset to find outliers based on data consistency. The ann-thyroid and credit-card fraud detection datasets had good precision and AUPRCs of 0.557 and 0.223, respectively. After extracting image features with Resnet-50 and VGG-19, we expanded the technique to handwritten digit dataset.

RESNET Neural network ResNet employs Batch Normalization. Batch Normalisation changes the input layer to boost network performance. Reduces covariate shift. The identity connection protects ResNet from vanishing gradients. This architecture extracted our dataset features.
